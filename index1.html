    <p>Hard work is the most important key to success. Achievements without hard work are impossible. An idle person can never gain anything if they sit and wait for a better opportunity to come. The person who is working hard is able to gain success and happiness in life. Nothing is easy to be achieved in life without doing any hard work.The Edison was working for 21 hours a day, and he sleeps only for 2 or 3 hours on the laboratory tables with his books as his pillow. The prime minister of India late Pt. Nehru, he was working for 17 hours a day and seven days a week. There were no holidays on his calendar. The Mahatma Gandhi Ji worked ceaselessly day and night and he won freedom for his country. The hard work is a price that we pay for success in life.
