    <p> Smart work is putting the minimum effort which causes the maximum impact on the result. Hard work focuses on the quantity and efforts while smart work is mainly based on quality and planned approach to a respective goal.‘Dreams don’t work unless you do’. Well, we have often heard that ‘Work smart and not hard’, but what really is smart work. Does only smart work brings you success, and if so then why are so many of us still busy putting our blood and sweat into working hard to reach our goals? Whether we should opt for smart or hard work, which will bring us more efficient results is one of the topics we often hear being discussed among people. Well, let’s break the ice and talk about Smart Work vs Hard Work.So let’s start with some basic examples: Ages back the cage man pushed his cart or huge pieces of stone for carrying it from one place to the other.But the modern man-made wheelbarrow easily carries its load and travels long distances with less effort and with more efficiency.This is a classic example of smart work. When we work for a given task depending on its worth and put our effort and apply our brain in order to produce maximum results by using minimum labor then it is known as Smart Work.Whereas Hard work is all about consistently working towards a particular goal irrespective of its worth and not being worried about the result or not using any means to reduce your effort. </p>
