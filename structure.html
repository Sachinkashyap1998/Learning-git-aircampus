   <p> Success is about being happy with an outcome and doing something correctly. It is about feeling accomplished when something is finished. Making money and getting fame is a reward for success. Success is setting a goal, putting others first, and doing what you have to do to achieve the goal.

<p>Failure is defined as a lack of success or the inability to meet an expectation. The problem is that we can read too much into failure. Too often, we tie it to our sense of self-worth, self-esteem, and self-acceptance.
